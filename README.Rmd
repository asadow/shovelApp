shovelApp is a Shiny application/R package for deploying a checklist table of whether University of Guelph shovel routes have been completed. The only user activity is a Regenerate button to update the table given that the sourced Googlesheet undergoes updates (mainly between 11:30 AM to 11:50 AM each day).
