Title: Snow Shovel Routes Checklist
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Adam", "Sadowski", , "asadowsk@uoguelph.ca", role = c("cre", "aut"))
Description: A summary of whether shovel routes were completed.  The data
    comes from Qualtrics route checklists that the snow shovelers fill out
    after they complete their routes each day, even if no action is
    required. Maria Dimacuha (mdimac01@uoguelph.ca) used to manually check
    the data and sends this information out at noon everyday from December
    to March.  It’s simply a ‘pass/fail’ compliance report.
